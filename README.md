# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Debanjan Bhuinya**, a software engineer with a focus on logic and infrastructure.

I believe in building strong foundations—whether that's through code or containers.

Currently, I spend my time balancing two worlds: sharpening my problem-solving skills by grinding **LeetCode in C++**, and building scalable infrastructure using **DevOps tools**.

My main tech stack involves **Docker** for containerization and **Kubernetes (K8s)** for orchestration. I am actively working on automating workflows and ensuring that "it works on my machine" means it works everywhere.

If you are looking for me, I'm probably optimizing an algorithm or debugging a deployment pipeline.

**Fun Facts:**
